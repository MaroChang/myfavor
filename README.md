### User Story

As Bobby,

> I can also upload photo as proof that I gave Alice 1x coffee - and then delete the favor owned to Alice.

As Alice,
> I also see what I owns other people, and other people who owns me things.

As James,
> I can  remove the favor that people owned me, without upload any photo
> I can add a favor that Alice owned me, but I have to upload a photo as proof first.

As Kim,
> I'm an unregistered user, I can see the Leaderboard but cannot interact with it
> I can also see the Request Board
> I can either Login with username/password or Register.

As Carol,
> I post a request to clean a fridge and add rewards (the request should show 1x coffee and 1x chocolate offered by Carol)
> I have a request to give me a lift home with a reward of 1x pizza. However as not needed anymore, I remove the reward of 1x Pizza and now the request has been deleted.

As Greg,
> I see Carol request, and add to the request ( the request will now show 1x coffee + 1x chocolate by Carol and 1x chocolate by Greg).

### Short Answer Questions

#### 1. What are the most important aspects of quality software?

The most important aspects of quality software are:

1. **Functions as expected** (i.e.buttons work) - The software was designed to serve a purpose (minimum viable product - MVP) and ultimately it should function as intended. This is ultimately the most important aspect of quality software and the MVP should be working, such as booking forms should be able to make a booking and inform the business. The intended user should be able to use the MVP as intended.

2. **No bugs** - In keeping with the first aspect of “functions as expected” - Quality software should have no bugs (or very minimal bugs), which means continuous testing and maintenance of the software would be something that quality software has.

3. Software code is **well documented** and has **code comments** - Good documentation and code comments help the next developers update/maintain the software, as well as give new users a guide to how to use the software when they are starting out.

4. Easy **usability/navigation** - Quality software should be intuitive to use and not require a thick manual to enable clients/users to use it. Using recognizable icons and having a typical standard layout for a web app/site, allows ease of use and thus better user experience. Accessibility, such as color contrast for color blind users and also accessibility while using a mobile device is also important, as more people are using mobile devices to access software.

#### 2. What libraries are being used in the app and why?

- React-DOM - this is the library we need to access for frontend

- **React** - this is the library we need to access for frontend
- **React-DOM** - this is the library we need to access for frontend
- **React-Router-DOM** - for frontend
- **React-redux** - for frontend
- **Express** - this is used for the backend
- **Mongoose** - helps create schemas and models for MongoDB
- **DotENV** - A package to be able to use our env file inside our application
